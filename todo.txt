photo or video to ascii
  - compress the frame to fewer pixels by iterating the pixels by taking average of certain block of the frame
  - iterate through the compressed frame and convert it to a ascii character
  
char convertToChar(uint_t pixel) {
  char[] table = " .:a@#";
  size_t n = sizeof(table) - 1;
  int index = (((0xFF000000&pixel)>>8*3))*n/256;
  return table[index];
